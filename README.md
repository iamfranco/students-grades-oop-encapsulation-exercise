# Students Grades OOP Encapsulation Exercise

This is a solution to the Exercises in Tech Returner's Class Diagram & Encapsulation Activity

Here we have two folders and a file:

1. The `StudentsExercise` folder contains the `Student` class, which is the solution to the exercise.
2. The `StudentsExercise.Tests` folder contains the unit test code for the `Student` class
3. The `UML.png` file is the UML diagram for the `Student` class.
